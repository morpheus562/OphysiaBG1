~We're lucky that all these ugly bandits seem to love carrying around letters from their bosses. I'd bet real gold that we can follow this paper trail all the way to the top. Here's a tip for if you ever put together a villanous plot—word of mouth leaves no evidence.~
	END
		IF~~THEN REPLY ~You've given this an awful lot of thought. You're not plotting to overthrow the Sword Coast, are you?~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.02
		IF~~THEN REPLY ~Only if you're pulling off petty heists. A larger plot requires a deft hand.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.03
		IF~~THEN REPLY ~I'm just happy things are going our way.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.04
		IF~~THEN REPLY ~We really don't have time to discuss this, Ophysia.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.05

CHAIN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.02
~Not in this lifetime. I've dabbled in a few schemes before—you know, the whole 'steal from the rich and eat well for a week' type of thing. Nothing TOO nefarious.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.06

CHAIN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.03
~There's careful, and then there's this. Do they use regular messengers, or bandit messengers? Wouldn't that just be the worst job? Running correspondence back and forth between people who think they're the smartest, most important people alive?~
== WNOPHYJ ~And to have the law on your tail too! You couldn't pay me to be a bandit messenger.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.06

CHAIN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.04
~Me too, but I'm wary of our luck running out. Eventually we'll run out of people telling us where to go, what to do, and how to do it. I'm perfectly happy to follow the pointed arrow until that happens though.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.06

CHAIN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.06
~I wonder what kind of reward we'll get once we're done with it. Maybe the dukes of Baldur's Gate themselves will dump a load of gold on us and herald us as heroes. Gods know they can afford it.~
		END
		IF~~THEN REPLY ~I wouldn't mind that. Fame and riches certainly have their appeal.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.07
		IF~~THEN REPLY ~I'm hoping for a bit more than a congratulations and a pat on the back, at least.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.08
		IF~~THEN REPLY ~Those things don't interest me. I'm doing this because it's the right thing to do.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.09

~They're empty promises, unfortunately. Heroes are forgotten and gold remains hoarded until its owner is inevitably plucked from this mortal coil.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.12

CHAIN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.08
~It'll be one or the other. I've managed to lose all the coin I've ever received and no title granted to me has ever stuck, so I'll probably end up right back where I started.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.12

CHAIN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.09
~Oh, how noble. I suppose you'll refuse any reward, and let the gold reside with those who need it the least? I'm sure the dukes wouldn't miss it.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.12

CHAIN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.10
~Hey, keep that chin up. We're doing well, and if we KEEP doing well then we might end up with a boatload of coin at the end of it.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.12

CHAIN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.12
~Better to take that gold and do something good with it, though. Who knows—by showing a little kindness we might be able to prevent the next plot to throw the Sword Coast into turmoil.~
== WNOPHYJ ~Not that I'm trying to induct you into a life of philanthrophy. I just don't like sitting idly when there are things that I can do to help people.~

		IF~~THEN REPLY ~I admire that. It's a noble trait to have.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ PaperTrail.14

~I can see why you might think so, library <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Look a little beneath the surface, though, and you'll realize what kind of place this is.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ CityTalk.07

~The rich and the pompous in the upper city live in a state of ignorant bliss, while there are men and women down in the dirt who have to beg for gold to get by. The worst part of it all? The dukes are totally, completely unwilling to do anything to fix it.~

~It's not personal to Baldur's Gate. Most cities are like this... I just hate seeing it up close.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ CityTalk.13

~The dukes are a bunch of retired adventurers, so long removed from their glory days that they've forgotten that they once tried to HELP people. Now they just sit around in their fancy castle and expect the Fist to clean up all the mess in the streets.~ EXTERN WNOPHYJ CityTalk.13
